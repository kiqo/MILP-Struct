# TreeTorsoWidth

This library enables to compute approximations of Treewidth, Torso-Width and Treedepth for large
graph instances. 

It is built on the libtw library from https://github.com/WPettersson/libtw, originally from  http://www.treewidth.com, with some adapations for the computation of the treewidth lower and upper bound approximations.
